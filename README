Motivation:
Some laptops (like the Lenovo/IBM Thinkpad T460 that I use), don't have any
HDD LED disk activity indicator, and that just won't do!!!

We'd like to simulate this using software, and an LED on the laptop that we
do have control over (eg., the Power Led #0 over the procfs interface;
details below).


ledio 2> io.dat

io.dat : ASCII text CSV file - contains the CSV of the value of /proc/diskstats
"# IOs currently in progress" incremental field; currently captured once every
5 ms.

led_putios:
Write a C prg that reads CSV of 'ios in progress" from stdin; feed io.dat as
stdin to it:
  ./led_putios < io.dat

led_putios prg will interpret the 'ios in progress' numbers, and if it's zero, will
turn OFF the IBM Thinkpad Power LED (LED #0, accessed via /proc/acpi/ibm/led ;
 echo "0 off" > /proc/acpi/ibm/led
).

Depending on whether the ios cross a threshold (TBD), we switch the LED on.
